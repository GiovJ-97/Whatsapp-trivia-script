9. Select the options before starting the game, such as:
- `Tag members` to mention all participants in the group before sending a new question.
- `Nation Order` to organize by nationality (many countries in the Americas are included).
- `Nation Resume` for a breakdown of the percentage each nation represents in the group.
- `Repeat` to repeat all the questions.
- `Randomnize` to shuffle the question order.
- `Correct Answers` is the number of correct answers needed to move to the next question. If the game is stuck because fewer correct answers were received, decrease this number and then restore it once a new question is being prepared to be sent.
- `Enumerate` to number all the questions.
- `Bold` to bold all the questions and text.
- `Italic` to italicize all the questions and text.
- `Uppercase` to convert all the questions and text to uppercase.
